# Lainux-font
An open-source and customisable font for all purposes. Designed with Fontforge.

It is made as a side project just for my entertainment  (and also for learning how to make fonts). I don't expect it to be used everywhere.

# Disclaimer
- The Lainux font won't get a sans-serif or monotype version, simply because I don't want to make those right now. I'll probably make them in future versions.
- I am not a professional when it comes to typefaces, in fact, I only know the three main types of fonts (sans-serif, serif and monotype)
