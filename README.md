# Ladora
An open-source and customisable font for all purposes. Designed with Fontforge.

It is made as a side project just for my entertainment  (and also for learning how to make fonts). I don't expect it to be used everywhere.

## FAQ
### What is that name?
It's a made-up word. If you want to know how it was made, I took "La dorée" (french for "the golden" in feminine), glued it together and replaced the last double `ée` with an `a`.

### Is your font based on any other font?
Well, I wouldn't say based in the sense that I took another font and modified it, but rather in terms of inspiration. In this case, I used MS Reference as my reference.

## Current state
So far, I've made *only* 9 letters (A to I in uppercase).

## Disclaimer
- The Ladora font won't get a sans-serif or monotype version, simply because I don't want to make those right now. I'll probably make them in future versions.
- I am not a professional when it comes to typefaces, in fact, I only know the three main types of fonts (sans-serif, serif and monotype).
