# Ladora
An open-source and customisable font for all purposes. Designed with Fontforge.

It is made as a side project just for my entertainment  (and also for learning how to make fonts). I don't expect it to be used everywhere. Tho it could be one day. Perhaps.

## Nesaura's branch
At Nesaura, we'll design the sans-serif version of Ladora. Once that is done, we'll do the monotype version.
